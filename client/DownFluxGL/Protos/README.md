# DownFlux Protobufs

Protobuf definitions are defined in the repo root. This directory only keeps
track of symlinks to the proto files.

`DownFluxGL.csproj` has a directive to include these proto files. Make sure
these proto definitions are included in the project file to be included in the
client build.
